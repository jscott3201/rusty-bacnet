# BACnet Standard 135-2020 Support Summary

> DRAFT internal support evidence. Generated from `docs/conformance/bacnet-135-2020.json`; this is not a BTL certification claim or formal PICS/BIBB declaration.

- Standard: ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 135-2020
- Reviewed at: 2026-08-12
- Implementation evidence SHA reviewed: `0c7be9744ffa8540ef95a7b84951ff376831c532`
- Scope: Write-path structured-value decode tranche (branch codex/write-path-decode; issue #182): WriteProperty and WritePropertyMultiple loop-decode the entire propertyValue payload into a scalar or PropertyValue::List (mirroring encode_property_value's List flattening) with full consumption required (a partial or undecodable element is PROPERTY / INVALID_DATA_ENCODING); the Loop reference properties and Pulse Converter Input_Reference accept their Clause 21 BACnetObjectPropertyReference / BACnetSetpointReference wire frames and reject device-qualified members [3]; and the decode unlocks MSI Alarm_Values whole-list writes plus the datetime-paired Date/Time pair properties (DateTime Value Present_Value and Priority_Array entries, and Relinquish_Default on DateTime Value and DateTime Pattern Value — the last two tranche-L1 exclusions, completing #270). Conventions unchanged: `repo_sha` names the last code commit of the PR branch (this docs-refresh commit lands after it), matching how the previous tranches recorded their reviewed SHA.
- Addenda/errata: Local source `_spec/2020_ASHRAE_Standard-135-BACnet-Data-Communication-Protocol.pdf` was reviewed for the Clause 15.9 / 15.10 write-service result text and the Clause 15.9.1.3 error table, the Clause 12.17 Loop clause and Table 12-20 (the reference-property types), the Clause 12.23 Pulse Converter Input_Reference text, the Clause 12.38 Table 12-45 and Clause 12.46 value-object tables, and the Clause 21 BACnetObjectPropertyReference / BACnetSetpointReference productions. No external addenda/errata check was performed for this tranche; per-row scope is recorded in each row's notes.

## Follow-Up Source

Rows not marked `supported-with-clause-evidence` are the initial follow-up backlog. Later PRs should split broad family rows into smaller clause-backed rows before strengthening public support claims.
