### Client

- Async client built on Tokio with Transaction State Machine (TSM)

- APDU segmentation receive with configurable window size
- Automatic device discovery via WhoIs with device cache
- Invoke ID management with retry logic (configurable retries and timeout)
- Support for BIP, BIP6, and SC transports via generic `TransportPort` trait
- Builder pattern: `bip_builder()`, `sc_builder()`, `generic_builder()`

### Server

- Async server with automatic APDU dispatch for 17 service handlers
